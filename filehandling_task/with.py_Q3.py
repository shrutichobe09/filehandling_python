q3 What is the purpose of the with statement when working with files in Python?

1. The `with` statement automatically closes the file after the block is executed, even if thereâ€™s an error.  
2. It makes the code cleaner by removing the need to manually call `file.close()`.  
3. It handles errors by ensuring the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs.  
4. The `with` statement ensures system resources, like file handles, are properly managed and freed.  
5. It uses a context manager to automatically handle the opening and closing of the file.  
6. It reduces boilerplate code, making file handling more efficient and less error-prone.
