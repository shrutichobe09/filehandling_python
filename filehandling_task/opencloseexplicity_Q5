"""
Q 5) What is the difference between using open() and close() explicitly versus using a
 context manager (with statement) to handle file operations?

"""
# Open the file explicitly
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
try:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
finally:
    # Always close the file in the finally block to ensure it's closed even if an error occurs
    file.close()



"""

You manually open the file using open().
After working with the file, you explicitly close it using file.close().
If an error occurs before calling file.close(), the file might not get closed properly 
unless you put file.close() in a finally block to ensure it's always executed.

drawback 
You must manually handle closing the file.
Thereâ€™s a risk of forgetting to close the file, which could cause resource leaks or unexpected behavior.
