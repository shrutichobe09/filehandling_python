1. Text Files
- Text files store data as plain human-readable characters. 
Each character is represented using a specific character encoding (usually UTF-8, ASCII, or other text encoding formats).
- In a text file, the data is composed of readable characters such as letters, numbers,
 spaces, punctuation marks, and control characters like newlines (e.g., \n or \r\n).
- Each character in a text file is typically stored as one byte (in ASCII encoding) or more (in UTF-8 encoding).
 The content can be viewed and edited in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text).

Use cases:Text files are used for storing human-readable information such as:
Plain text documents (.txt)
Source code files (.py, .html, .cpp)
Configuration files (.cfg, .ini)


2. Binary Files
- Binary files store data in a format that is not human-readable.
 They contain raw data encoded as a series of bytes, which can represent anything from images, videos,
   audio, compressed data, or even compiled programs.
- The content of binary files is a sequence of 0s and 1s (binary data) that represent more 
complex structures, such as:
Graphics (e.g., .jpg, .png)
Audio files (e.g., .mp3, .wav)
